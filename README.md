# Supply-Chain-Analysis

 November Onyx #dataDNA challenge! 
 For this challenge, I designed three interactive dashboards to provide comprehensive insights into supply chain performance:
- Overview Dashboard: Highlights product sales, profit, and top-selling SKUs, making it easy to identify revenue drivers.
- Logistics & Supplier Dashboard: Focuses on supplier performance, shipping analysis, and transportation methods. This dashboard is aimed at optimizing supplier collaboration and improving logistical efficiency.
- Inventory Dashboard: Provides insights into stock levels and SKU performance, ensuring clear visibility into inventory trends.

## Objectives

### Questions
- Which product category contributes the highest to gross profit and overall revenue?
- How does revenue distribution vary across different gender segments?
- Which locations contribute the highest revenue, and what products are most popular in these areas?
- Which SKUs have the highest sales volumes, and what makes them top sellers?
- What percentage of products pass inspection, and what are the most common inspection issues?
- What are the revenue and profit margins for these top-selling SKUs?
- What is the total cost of shipping, and how does this vary by transport mode?
- Which transportation modes are most commonly used, and are they the most cost-effective or time-efficient?
- How do shipping costs vary across different transportation modes and routes?
- What is the relationship between shipping cost and time for each transport mode?
- Which suppliers generate the most revenue, and are they also the most profitable?
- Which suppliers offer the best balance between shipping time and cost?
- How does shipping time vary by carrier, and are some carriers faster than others?
- Which carriers offer the best balance between cost and shipping time?



## Key Findings and Insights
- Revenue and Product Performance:
   -  Total Revenue: The total revenue generated is $577,605, with Skincare products leading in revenue contribution at $241,628, followed by Haircare and Cosmetics.
Top-Selling SKUs: SKU10 (Skincare) and SKU94 (Cosmetics) are the top-performing products, with high sales volumes of 996 and 987 units, respectively. SKU94 stands out for generating over $7,888 in revenue, indicating strong consumer demand.
   -  Revenue by Gender: Male and female customers contribute significantly to revenue, with Female customers contributing $161,514 and Male customers contributing $126,634. This suggests a balanced customer base with targeted marketing potential.
- Cost and Pricing Analysis:
    -  Average Price and Manufacturing Costs: The average price across products is $49.46. There are notable differences in costs, with some SKUs (e.g., SKU7) having high manufacturing costs at $99.46 (likely premium products), while others, like SKU6, maintain low costs at $1.08, indicating a value segment.
   -  Cost-Effective Transport Modes: Road transport is the most frequently used mode for logistics, likely due to its accessibility. However, Rail and Sea transport offer more cost-effective options for products that are less time-sensitive.
- Supplier Performance and Shipping Efficiency:
   -  Lead Time and Defect Rates: The average lead time across suppliers is 17.08 days, with Supplier 4 having the longest lead time of 18.63 days. The average defect rate is 2.28%, and Supplier 1 has the highest reliability, providing multiple high-revenue SKUs and maintaining a low defect rate.
    - Carrier and Route Efficiency: Carrier B is the most commonly used but not the most cost-efficient, with Carrier C being better suited for time-sensitive deliveries. Air transport incurs the highest cost and is used for urgent shipments, while Rail and Sea are leveraged for bulk, less urgent deliveries.
- Inventory and Inspection:
   -  Product Inspection Results: A small percentage of products fail inspection, indicating quality control measures are in place. However, 10% of products are pending inspection, suggesting potential for tighter quality monitoring.
   -   Inventory Management: Stock levels indicate a balanced inventory, but certain high-demand SKUs could benefit from enhanced restocking strategies to avoid stockouts.

## Recommendations
- Enhance Product-Specific Marketing and Stock Management: Increase stock levels for top-selling SKUs (SKU10, SKU94) to meet demand and avoid stockouts. Consider targeted promotions for high-demand items to maximize revenue, particularly in Skincare and Cosmetics.
- Optimize Transportation Costs and Efficiency:
   -  Expand the use of Rail and Sea transport for products that have flexible delivery timelines to reduce shipping costs. For high-priority shipments, Carrier C should be prioritized over Carrier A due to better cost efficiency with minimal compromise on delivery speed.
  -  Explore alternative routes or negotiate better rates with carriers, especially for routes where Air transport is used, as itâ€™s significantly more costly.
- Strengthen Supplier Relationships and Quality Control:
    -  Continue building relationships with Supplier 1 due to their high revenue contribution and reliability. For suppliers with higher defect rates or lead times (e.g., Supplier 4), explore process improvements or alternative suppliers to maintain quality standards.
    -  Reduce pending inspections by automating part of the quality control process to ensure timely inspection and minimize potential delays in shipping.
- Improve Cost Management for Premium and Low-Cost Products:
   -  Evaluate the pricing strategy for high-cost items like SKU7 to ensure profitability. If demand is low, consider product bundling or promotions to increase sales without compromising margins.
   -  For lower-cost SKUs, explore cost-saving measures in manufacturing or packaging to increase profit margins while maintaining customer satisfaction.
- Detailed Gender-Based Marketing Strategies: Since both male and female customers contribute significantly to revenue, consider tailored marketing strategies to cater to these groups, especially focusing on skincare products that have broader appeal across genders.
- Implement Real-Time Monitoring of Inventory and Supply Chain Metrics: A real-time inventory monitoring system can help in proactively managing stock levels, tracking inspection status, and optimizing lead times. This could prevent delays and reduce the risk of stockouts, especially for high-demand SKUs.
